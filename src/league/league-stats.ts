/**
 * League-wide player career stats — pure aggregation over match results.
 *
 * The app tracks rankings per *season* (`SeasonRanks`). These helpers roll a
 * single player's results up across every season in a league into a career
 * card: totals, best/worst partner, and nemeses. They are deliberately pure and
 * immutable so they can be unit-tested in isolation and folded from either the
 * event store or in-memory fixtures.
 *
 * Data source: the `SEASON_MATCH_REGISTERED` event (`{ winners, losers }`),
 * which covers both 1v1 (one id per side) and 2v2 (two ids per side). Teammates
 * therefore only accrue in 2v2 play; a singles-only league yields no partner.
 *
 * Best/worst teammate and nemeses are ranked by a Laplace-smoothed win/loss
 * ratio among pairings that clear a minimum-games gate — both knobs are tunable
 * (see `RankingOptions` / `rankingOptionsFromEnv`). Each record still carries
 * the full, unsmoothed win/loss tally so the card can display the pairing's
 * real win/loss ratio.
